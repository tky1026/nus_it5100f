        <h3>Data Preprocessing & EDA</h3>
        <p>In this section, we focused on preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, ensuring data consistency, and transforming the data into a usable format. Key steps include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data cleaning: Handling null values and outliers.</li>
            <li>Transformation: Standardizing columns and converting timestamps.</li>
            <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial visualizations and distributions of key variables.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supervised Learning Techniques</h3>
        <p>In this section, we explored various supervised learning algorithms to classify workout intensity based on user features such as speed and heart rate. The key components of this analysis included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Preparation: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and normalizing the data.</li>
            <li>Model Training: Implementing and training multiple regression models, including linear regression and polynomial regression.</li>
            <li>Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.</li>
        </ul>

    <div id="unsupervised-learning" class="panel">
        <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
        <p>In this section, we applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify patterns in workout data and suggest potential workout buddies based on similar workout profiles. Key tasks included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Preprocessing: Filtering data and computing relevant metrics such as average speed and workout duration.</li>
            <li>K-Means Clustering: Using K-means clustering to categorize users based on their workout characteristics.</li>
            <li>Cluster Analysis: Visualizing clusters to identify similar users and recommend workout partners.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Further Exploration</h3>
        <p>In this section, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of workout patterns and intensity classifications based on user activity data. The analysis tasks included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Descriptive Analysis: Investigating workout metrics, such as average heart rate and unique sessions across different sports.</li>
            <li>Predictive Analysis: Classifying workout intensity levels using K-means clustering and understanding user workout behavior.</li>
            <li>Visualizations: Creating meaningful visualizations to support our findings and highlight trends in user workouts.</li>
        </ul>
